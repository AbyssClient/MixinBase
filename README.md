# MixinBase
Mixins client base for 1.8.9

# How to setup
Clone the repository into whatever folder you want (Mine is in my coding folder), open the project in Intellij IDEA then go to the gradle tab on the right
and run setupDecompWorkspace in the buid/forgegradle, once that's done run genIntellijRuns, when that's completed a run configuration
should pop-up named "Minecraft Client", copy the settings from the image below

Now you can start Minecraft!
